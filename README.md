# Web development projects
## Some of my projects throughout 2022

* All source code is written by me.
* Special thanks to [Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat) for providing me material such as fun challenges and images/links to work with.

### 1. LoginForm
* It was a bit hard to develop the technique for this one, and even after hours of trying, it's still incomplete. The CSS code is kind of dumb and I haven't used JS, but at least I've learned how to use media queries (and fix some bugs). Worth it.

### 2. SocialTree
* As a beginner, I would have to say that responsiveness of the webpage is a really difficult thing to master. This time, I didn't use media queries, because it didn't feel necessary. Anyway, this was easier because working with flexbox is so much better when you acquire experience. Nevertheless, I still have a bit of struggle within the design area, however, progress has been made.

### 3. AnimatedSidebar
* Programming hits hard. I've made a rookie mistake in the layout which made it impossible to progress, since I would have to create the entire open sidebar with JS. ðŸ’€
